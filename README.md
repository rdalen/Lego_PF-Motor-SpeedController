## Lego Power Function (PF) Motor speed controller

I made my own versions of a speed controller for Lego PF motors after [this](https://www.toypro.com/nl/product/54279/power-controller-voor-lego-power-functions?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=11441466193&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VCxSRBgGp-f_SLISsrgKkRwWOlxM40EZKS2sQz4RLvHa6dNschsDmRoCfCwQAvD_BwE) product.

This module contains a commercial HW-70 PWM Motor speed controller Module.

I bought a couple of these modules on AliExpress (for approx. 1â‚¬25 each) and made an snapfit encloser for it in FreeCad

On AliExpress you can also buy the PF connector and wire to make a DIY Lego PF connection cable.  
When assembling the PF cable, remove the C1 and C2 contacts from the Bottom part of the connector

Because the output voltage cannot be reversed it is suitable e.g. as an LED dimmer

Below is a modified design where the motor can be changed direction using a DPDT switch.

And I made this snapfit encloser for it

The screw connector HW-70 PWM Motor Module is replaced by a header connector, after that all connections are soldered and tested
