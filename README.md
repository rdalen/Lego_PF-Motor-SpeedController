.## Lego Power Function (PF) Motor speed controller

I made my own versions of a speed controller for Lego PF motors after [this](https://www.toypro.com/nl/product/54279/power-controller-voor-lego-power-functions?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=11441466193&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VCxSRBgGp-f_SLISsrgKkRwWOlxM40EZKS2sQz4RLvHa6dNschsDmRoCfCwQAvD_BwE) product.

This module contains a commercial HW-70 PWM Motor speed controller

I bought a couple of these modules on AliExpress (approx. 1â‚¬25 each) and made this encloser for it in FreeCad

On AliExpress you can also buy the PF connector and wire. 

Because the output voltage cannot be reversed it is suitable e.g. as an LED dimmer

Below is a modified design where the motor can be changed direction using a DPDT switch.
