## Lego Power Function (PF) Motor speed controller

I made my own versions of a speed controller for Lego PF motors after [this](https://www.toypro.com/nl/product/54279/power-controller-voor-lego-power-functions?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=11441466193&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VCxSRBgGp-f_SLISsrgKkRwWOlxM40EZKS2sQz4RLvHa6dNschsDmRoCfCwQAvD_BwE) product.

This module contains a commercial HW-70 PWM Motor Speed Controller Module.  
It is based on the well known NE555 timer-IC to make a PWM ouput signal.

I bought a couple of these modules on AliExpress (for approx. 1â‚¬25 each) and made a small snapfit enclosure for it in FreeCad

On AliExpress you can also buy the PF connector and wire to make a DIY Lego PF connection cable.  
When assembling the PF cable, remove the C1 and C2 contacts from the Bottom part of the connector
so that only 1 connector is required to connect both the battery box and the motor.

Because the output voltage cannot be reversed it is more suitable as an LED dimmer

Below is a modified design where the motor can be changed direction using a DPDT switch.

It fits in this larger snapfit enclosure

First of al the screw connector on the HW-70 Module is replaced by a header connector, after that all connections are soldered and tested

and mounted into the enclosure

To make the stripes on the potentiometer scale, color in the lines with a black marker and wipe it clean with alcohol, leaving the stripes.

I also made a [version](https://github.com/rdalen/Lego_PF-Motor-SpeedController_Neopixel-version) based on an Arduino ProMini (or clone) and has a DRV8833 Motor driver module, a Rotary encoder and a 16 LED Neopixel Ring as forward/reverse speedindicator
